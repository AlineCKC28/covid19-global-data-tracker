# 🦠 COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

A polished, well-documented, and reproducible project to analyze and visualize global COVID-19 data using Python.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Load and clean public COVID-19 datasets.
- Explore key metrics: total cases, deaths, per-capita indicators, and vaccinations.
- Produce clear visualizations and simple, reusable analysis utilities.
- Ensure the notebook runs end-to-end without manual tweaks.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** (data wrangling)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (static charts)
- **Plotly** (interactive charts)
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## ▶️ How to Run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/covid19-global-tracker.git
cd covid19-global-tracker
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook covid19_tracker.ipynb
```
> Run all cells from top to bottom. The notebook handles data download directly from Our World in Data.

## 📊 What You’ll See
- Global time series of cases and deaths.
- Top countries by cumulative cases.
- Per-capita comparisons (cases/deaths per million).
- Vaccination progress overview (if present in the dataset).

## 💡 Notes
- Data source: Our World in Data (OWID).
- This repository is educational and can be extended with forecasts, dashboards, or country filters.
